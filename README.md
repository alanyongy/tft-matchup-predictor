This was a rapid solo prototype with some copy-pasting and hardcoded logic. The source is included for completeness but is not polished or optimized. For a deeper understanding, please refer to the project writeup and overview.

This project was originally developed five years ago when I was just starting out with programming. While the codebase reflects an early learning phase and isn’t up to my current standards, the project remains a valuable demonstration of my problem-solving skills and creativity. Since then, my coding practices and architectural design skills have significantly improved, as you’ll see in my more recent projects.
